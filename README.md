# A novel pseudo-random number generator based on multivariable optimization for image-cryptographic applications
Project to implement a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) using Elliptic Curve (EC) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for image cryptographic applications. \
Based on the paper: [A novel pseudo-random number generator based on multivariable optimization for image-cryptographic applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423029482?via%3Dihub) by Takreem Haider, Sa√∫l A. Blanco, Umar Hayat 

## Setup

1. Use `poetry` to install dependencies:
